ABOUT GITHUB


GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 
This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.
It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. 
It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source 
projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly 
network, collaborate, and pitch their work.
